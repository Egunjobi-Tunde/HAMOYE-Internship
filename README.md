Dataset Description
The dataset link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00374/

The dataset for the remainder of this quiz is the Appliances Energy Prediction data. The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru), and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non predictive attributes (parameters). The attribute information can be seen below.

# HAMOYE-STAGE-D-CODE
## Neural Network, Image Recognition &amp; Object Detection


The Repository contains the notebook used to build artificial intelligence algorithms to label satellite image chips with different atmospheric conditions and the different classes of land cover/land use.  For this Multi-class Multi-Label problem, some of the labels are from the following categories: Cloud Cover (clear, partly, cloudy, haze), Primary RainForest, Water (rivers, lakes), Habitation (large city, small homes), Agriculture, Roads etc. The algorithms from this project will enable us to understand where, how and why deforestation happens.

it is a competition in Kaggle and the leaderboard score was uploaded along with it.


## HAMOYE-STAGE-E-CODE
#### Practical Time Series Analysis & Forecast

The archive contains 92,016 measurements of electricity data gathered between September 2010 and February 2021.

Notes:

The dataset is sampled on an hourly basis. It has the following features:

Attribute Information:

FullDate: Date in format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss ElecPrice: Prices of electricity charged in Kw per hour Gas Price: power generated was done via a gas power plant, gas price is the price of gas at time-T SysLoad: Total Load on system or Power consumed at time-T Tmax: maximum temperature at time-T
